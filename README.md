## Transformations and Step-by-Step 

ðŸ”¹ Source Qualifier (SQ): Extracts data from the source while filtering out unnecessary rows, ensuring only relevant data enters the ETL pipeline.

ðŸ”¹ Lookup Transformation (LKP): Checks for existing records to identify if the incoming row is a new record or an updateâ€”essential for managing historical data accurately.

ðŸ”¹ Router Transformation (RTR): Routes rows based on conditions (e.g., new vs. updated records) to handle inserts and updates separately, improving data flow efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ Sequence Generator (SEQ): Generates unique keys for new records, crucial for maintaining primary keys in slowly changing dimensions.

ðŸ”¹ Update Strategy (UPD): Specifies whether a record should be inserted or updated in the target, ensuring accurate versioning in SCD T2.

ðŸ”¹ Expression Transformation (EXP): Used to perform calculations and modify data fields before loadingâ€”this helps format and standardize data based on requirements.
